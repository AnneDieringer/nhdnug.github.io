"Many people are scared of the potential complexity and difficulty in starting with an Event Sourcing and CQRS technical strategy."

"Fear not though, the "Critter Stack" is here to provide a very low code ceremony approach to using Event Sourcing as your persistence strategy within a larger CQRS architecture. Using a combination of the Postgresql-backed Marten (https://martendb.io) library for event sourcing and its newer friend Wolverine (https://wolverine.netlify.app) for command handling and asynchronous messaging, I'll show you how you can quickly get started with both CQRS and Event Sourcing. Once we get past the quick start, I'll show you how the Critter Stack's unique approach to the "Decider" pattern will help you create robust command handlers with very little code ceremony while still enjoying easy testability."

"Moving beyond basic command handling into the realm of "grown up" systems development, we'll dive into how the critter stack supports effective test automation, built in telemetry, and even manages to provide high performance and scalable systems."
