"Summary:  We did it. We upgraded a large Windows/.NET Framework monolith to run on linux containers in Azure Kubernetes Service, and in the process simplified our infrastructure, improved security, and cut out the majority of our (significant!) compute spend. And that was over two years ago! Let's hop through each step of the process and talk through the what, the why, and what we'd do differently in 2023 (notably: Azure Container Apps). And yes, we blundered, and I’ll talk through some of the blunders. I have almost no shame, so the stories should be good…as long as there’s no permanent recording of this talk."

"Most of all, I’m hoping to hear from you on your own journey—so bring questions and share your own experience report! I will happily cede time during the presentation to anyone else who is willing to compare notes!"

"Giving credit: I will make several references to this excellent article that mirrors our experience, and I highly recommend anyone considering a migration to containers in Azure read it: https://techcommunity.microsoft.com/t5/fasttrack-for-azure/journey-to-containers/ba-p/3792199"
