"In the coming years AI and machine learning will continue to change our lives in meaningful ways, but not all of those ways will be positive. How are we going to measure and manage the impact of that AI on our society? Do we leverage AI in teaching children, and if so how? These are big questions facing us but will not be solved ( in the short term ) by regulations and politicians. They will be tackled by the people at the keyboards developing the systems that influence human decision making. In this talk we will dive into this problem space, and how simple practices can impact the outcomes significantly."
