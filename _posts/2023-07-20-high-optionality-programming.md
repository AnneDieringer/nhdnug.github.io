"High Optionality Programming" - the practice of paying a small design & programming premium today in order to avoid a massive accumulation of technical debt later. This is a technique we've successfully used at large scale in our previous business and in the businesses of many of our customers. The key to implementing high optionality programming correctly is to assess the likelihood of a future change to your system and to plan for its eventuality in advance when it's cheap to do so: early on in the software development lifecycle.In this talk we explain the concepts behind high optionality programming, offer some case studies of how it's been used successfully, and introduce the techniques that actively curb the long-term accumulation of technical debt in software projects.
